Have you ever played Minesweeper? It’s a cute little game which comes within a certain Operating System which name we can’t really remember. Well, the goal of the game is to ﬁnd where are all the mines within a M ×N ﬁeld. To help you, the game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square. For instance, supose the following 4×4 ﬁeld with 2 mines (which are represented by an ‘*’ character):

*... 
.... 
.*.. 
....

If we would represent the same ﬁeld placing the hint numbers described above, we would end up with:
*100 
2210 
1*10 
1110

As you may have already noticed, each square may have at most 8 adjacent squares.

Input
The input will consist of an arbitrary number of ﬁelds. The ﬁrst line of each ﬁeld contains two integers n and m (0 < n,m ≤ 100) which stands for the number of lines and columns of the ﬁeld respectively. The next n lines contains exactly m characters and represent the ﬁeld. Each safe square is represented by an ‘.’ character (without the quotes) and each mine square is represented by an ‘*’ character (also without the quotes). The ﬁrst ﬁeld line where n = m = 0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.


Output
For each ﬁeld, you must print the following message in a line alone:
Field #x:
Where x stands for the number of the ﬁeld (starting from 1). The next n lines should contain the ﬁeld with the ‘.’ characters replaced by the number of adjacent mines to that square. There must be an empty line between ﬁeld outputs.
